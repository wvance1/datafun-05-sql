The purpose of this file is to demonstrate usage of 
sql and database operations. Through this file and the 
files referenced below, I created a databse, added tables
 to the databse, filled the tables with data from both CSV
and .sql files, deleted information, changed information, 
queried the database and filtered, grouped, sorted and 
joined the data. All of this is doccumented in the README.
